# Sources and Evidence Register

Checked 12 September 2026. These are primary references for existing technologies;
they do not validate ecOS performance, security or commercial demand. Project
recommendations are inferences from these capabilities and the stated goals.
Documentation at moving URLs can change; pin versions during implementation.

## Project Baseline

- Original v0.1 planning specification, dated 11 September 2026; historical attachment excluded from the public distribution.
- Subsequent user direction: controlled specialized models, CogPOSIX as the central interface, an installable sovereign OS, bounded learning and cybersecurity research. Captured in [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md).

## OS Delivery

| [bootc installation](https://bootc.dev/bootc/bootc-install.html) | Image-to-bootable-system installation architecture |
| [Fedora image-mode change](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DNFAndBootcInImageModeFedora) | Fedora bootc packaging/workflows; a change document, not an ecOS support guarantee |
| [Debian Live manual](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual.en.html) | Custom live image construction; commands require release-specific validation |
| [Debian live install media](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/) | Existing installable desktop media |
| [NixOS manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/) | Declarative system management and generations |

| [Android Verified Boot](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/verifiedboot) | Device boot-integrity design |

The Fedora documentation landing page was access-blocked during research. The
recommendation uses accessible upstream bootc documentation and Fedora's project
wiki; a production base and desktop image have not been verified.
