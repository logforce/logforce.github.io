# Community Distribution and Service Notice

Version 1.2, 14 September 2026. Deliverable status updated; license grants unchanged.

## 1. Community Use

The public repository is a community design and development distribution. Its
software and documentation are governed by the licenses in
[LICENSE-SCOPE.md](LICENSE-SCOPE.md). Downloading, cloning, modifying, running or
redistributing that material does not enroll anyone in a paid service or require
acceptance of separate commercial terms. Those licenses govern their own grants,
conditions, warranty exclusions, liability limitations and termination provisions.

This notice explains product/service boundaries. It does not amend the licenses
or impose additional restrictions on their exercise.

## 2. Current Deliverables

The repository provides design documentation, publication tooling and an
experimental local runtime with Rust and C clients, a deterministic mock and an
optional Linux ONNX CPU worker for one pinned digit model. Model weights are not
included in the public source export; optional validation downloads them separately.
There is no general model collection, bootable OS, hosted inference endpoint,
managed security service or support SLA. Roadmaps are not contractual delivery
commitments. See the [worker limitations](docs/onnx-worker.md).

## 3. Independent Local Operation

The intended community product is usable without a LOGFORCE license, external
inference account or mandatory telemetry. Baseline permissions, isolation and
local-only enforcement belong to the community foundation. Optional proprietary
analysis must not be necessary for ordinary execution or conformance.

Repository downloads and community participation take place on the selected host
under that host's applicable terms and privacy practices. This notice does not
claim that an external Git host collects no data.

## 4. Optional Paid Services

Paid support, enterprise modules, managed deployments and LOGFORCE services require
a separate written agreement identifying the supplier, customer, scope, charges,
term, data handling and any service levels. No such agreement is created by using
the community repository. Private draft commercial terms are not incorporated by
reference into this notice.

The end of a subscription does not revoke rights independently held under an
open-source or open-documentation license. Proprietary entitlements and service
access are governed by their separate signed agreement.

## 5. Data and Models

Do not submit credentials, private customer data or confidential model artifacts
to public issues, examples or contributions. Third-party model assets need their
own permission and license review. A model being executable locally does not imply
that its weights or training data are freely redistributable.

No hosted processing or customer-data collection service is established by this
release. Before one is offered, the supplier must publish its applicable privacy
information and agree any required processing terms. Security and AI capabilities
do not imply certification, regulatory compliance or guaranteed threat prevention.

## 6. Brands and Support

Use of project names and any official compatibility mark is separate from the
copyright license. See [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md). There is no certification
program or commercial support commitment in this initial release.
